Hello! Iâ€™m **Yinzhu Jin**, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Virginia, advised by P. Thomas Fletcher.

I am excited to share that I will be graduating in **Fall 2025** and am currently seeking **postdoctoral positions** where I can continue my research and collaborate on innovative projects.

My research focuses on developing interpretability methods to better understand and explain deep learning models, especially in medical image analysis. I also work on generative modeling techniques to achieve better controllability in the generation process.

If you are interested in my work or potential collaboration opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me via email.
